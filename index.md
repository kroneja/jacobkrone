## Education

I am currently an undergraduate student in the [Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour](https://www.science.mcmaster.ca/pnb/) program at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/). My research interests include topics such as collective intelligence, education & cognition, and the cognitive science of religion. Currently, I am enrolled in an independent research project with Dr. Mayu Nishimura on the topic of the roots of collective intelligence and university group work. 

## Work

I am currently a Program Support Assistant for the [MacPherson Institute](https://mi.mcmaster.ca/) at McMaster University. I work with a multi-disciplinary team to enhance and support teaching and learning experiences at McMaster. Through MacPherson, I have been involved with various aspects of the [MacChangers](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/co-op-career/macchangers) program, including editing and finalizing important documents for student consultation. 

In addition, I am currently a tutor for course 2J03: Introduction to Statistics, which focuses on statistical concepts and their application to the analysis of data from the social sciences. 

In the past, I have worked various jobs from dishwashing to farm worker. One of my most memorable experiences was working as a camp counsellor for the [Lieutenant Governor's Indigenous Summer Reading Camp](https://www.frontiercollege.ca/FrontierCollege/media/documents/2019-National-Camp-Report-FINAL.pdf) in Attawapiskat, Ontario where we organized and operated a daily summer literacy camp for 6 weeks. 

## Volunteer

I am currently a volunteer for the [Education & Cognition Lab](https://edcog.ca/) at McMaster, which supports research exploring how cognitive principles can inform instructional design and critical issues in education to bridge the gap between the lab and classroom.

Additionally, I volunteer for [Frontier College](https://www.frontiercollege.ca/) through various programs such as the Student Alternative Learning program, Raz-Kids, and the Learning Together Club.
